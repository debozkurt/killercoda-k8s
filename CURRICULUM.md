# Polyphone Kubernetes Curriculum — Master Plan

The long-term curriculum, organized as four tiers. Tier 1 and Tier 2 are strictly linear and required for everyone. Tier 3 splits into three branchable tracks that can be taken in any order. Tier 4 is the capstone.

## Persona

You are an SRE at **Polyphone**, a fictional real-time communications SaaS. Polyphone operates a global fleet of Kubernetes clusters across regions (`us-east-1`, `us-west-2`, `eu-central-1`, `ap-southeast-1`) and tiers (`dev`, `lab`, `stage`, `prod`). The platform delivers voice, video, and messaging via a stack of media servers, SIP signaling components, telephony application logic, edge gateways, and the usual control/data/admin planes.

## The Polyphone fleet (17 workloads, 10 namespaces)

| Namespace        | Workload              | Role                                            |
|------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `media`          | `media-engine`        | RTP media processing (StatefulSet)              |
| `media`          | `session-broker`      | Allocates media resources                       |
| `media`          | `transcoder`          | Codec conversion (CPU-affinity)                 |
| `signaling`      | `sip-router`          | SIP request routing                             |
| `signaling`      | `sip-proxy`           | Front-edge SIP proxy                            |
| `signaling`      | `reg-proxy`           | Endpoint registration (StatefulSet)             |
| `app-services`   | `sip-app`             | SIP application server (call logic)             |
| `app-services`   | `presence`            | Presence/availability (StatefulSet)             |
| `app-services`   | `directory`           | Address book / contacts                         |
| `edge`           | `sbc-edge`            | Session Border Controller (DaemonSet)           |
| `edge`           | `pstn-gateway`        | PSTN trunk gateway (StatefulSet)                |
| `provisioning`   | `account-provisioner` | Tenant provisioning                             |
| `admin-portal`   | `portal-ui`           | Admin web UI                                    |
| `call-routing`   | `route-engine`        | Call routing decisions                          |
| `cdr-storage`    | `cdr-writer`          | Call Detail Records (PVC)                       |
| `analytics`      | `metrics-aggregator`  | Telemetry aggregation                           |
| `number-porting` | `port-processor`      | LNP workflows (ResourceQuota)                   |

The full fleet boots in every lesson's `baseline/` scenario. Each module's break/fix scenarios mutate one or two of these workloads to create a learnable failure.

**Module-layered workloads.** A module may layer extra workloads onto the standard fleet when its topic needs an archetype the base 17 don't cover — appended via a fenced enhancement in that module's `background.sh`, not added to `_baseline/`. M01b layers three batch workloads (run-to-completion / scheduled): `schema-migrate` (Job, `provisioning`), `usage-export` (parallel Job, `analytics`), `cdr-rollup` (CronJob, `cdr-storage`). They run `busybox` rather than the fleet's long-lived `nginx`, because batch pods must exit to complete. M02 layers `media-recorder` (`media`) plus an in-cluster private `registry` (registry:2 + htpasswd at `localhost:5000`) for its baseline tour and the registry-auth scenario, demonstrating an authenticated pull of a proprietary image. M03 adds no new workloads — it wires config objects (`app-config` ConfigMap, `portal-secrets` Secret) into existing fleet members (`session-broker`, `portal-ui`, `account-provisioner`) as environment variables and as mounted files. M04 adds no new workloads either — it exercises the Services the fleet already runs (`session-broker`, `route-engine`, `portal-ui`) and adds a single cross-namespace DNS env carrier (`BROKER_ENDPOINT` on `account-provisioner`) for the naming scenario. M05 adds no new workloads either — it exercises the fleet's existing PVC-backed workloads (`cdr-writer`, `directory`, and the StatefulSets' `volumeClaimTemplates`) on the `local-path` StorageClass; its scenarios mutate a claim's StorageClass, a Pod's `claimName`, and an RWO access-mode/topology conflict in place. M06 layers four small single-purpose workloads to make each scheduling failure concrete — `stream-analyzer` (`analytics`, an oversized memory request), `pstn-probe` (`edge`, missing a toleration for a node its scenario taints), `sip-director` (`signaling`, a 3-replica required pod anti-affinity), and `media-buffer` (`media`, a `busybox` in-memory buffer that OOMs under a too-low limit) — each appended via a fenced mutation in that scenario's `background.sh`; the one node taint is applied there too, not to `_baseline/`. M07 layers `session-store` (a 3-replica StatefulSet + governing headless Service, `app-services`) and `rtp-probe` (a DaemonSet, `edge`), giving the module its own identity-bearing and node-local archetypes. M09 layers one workload per resilience control — `sip-registrar` (Deployment + PodDisruptionBudget, `signaling`), `transcode-scaler` (Deployment + HPA, `media`), and `portal-web` (Deployment with revision history, `admin-portal`) — while VPA/KEDA/Cluster-Autoscaler stay concept-only (not installed on the cluster). M10 layers three `curlimages/curl` RBAC readers (`endpoint-watcher`/`media`, `route-watcher`/`call-routing`, `node-inspector`/`analytics`) that call the API as their own ServiceAccounts, plus `payments-api` in a new PodSecurity-`restricted` `payments` namespace. M24 layers `session-cache` (a 3-replica StatefulSet + headless Service, `media`) and `call-coordinator` (a 2-replica active/standby singleton whose `coordination.k8s.io` Lease is staged for reading, `call-routing`), reusing the StatefulSet identity M07 introduces. M08 layers a `MediaTenant` CRD plus a real `tenant-operator` (a legible `bitnami/kubectl` reconcile loop in a new `platform` namespace) that reconciles the `orion`/`lyra` tenant CRs into child `orion-media`/`lyra-media` Deployments — a live operator built from kubectl-in-a-pod so the control loop is both real and readable offline. M13 layers `call-metrics` (a Deployment + Service serving a Prometheus exposition document at `/metrics` from a ConfigMap, carrying the `prometheus.io/*` scrape annotations) so the scrape contract is exercised without installing a Prometheus stack. M14 adds no new fleet workloads — it installs the `ingress-nginx` controller and layers NetworkPolicies and an Ingress onto the existing fleet, driving traffic from throwaway `busybox` clients. M11 layers a `SecretSync` CRD plus a `secret-operator` (another legible kubectl reconcile loop) that reads a `secret-operator-store` in a new `secrets-source` namespace — a disclosed stand-in for Vault / a cloud secrets manager — and materializes consumer Secrets. M12 installs real cert-manager (its CRDs + controller + webhook + cainjector) and layers a `selfsigned-bootstrap` ClusterIssuer → `polyphone-internal-ca` → leaf Certificates plus an mTLS workload pair. M20 installs real Kyverno and layers ClusterPolicies (`require-resource-limits`, `add-owner-label`, `disallow-latest-tag`) that gate admission across the fleet; it adds no new fleet workloads. M15 installs real Istio (minimal profile, `istio-system`) and meshes the `media` namespace via sidecar injection, layering VirtualService / DestinationRule / PeerAuthentication onto the existing fleet; no new fleet workloads. M21 stands up `admission-guard` — a small python-based admission webhook server with self-hosted TLS in a new `admission` namespace — registered by a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration and a MutatingWebhookConfiguration, teaching the raw webhook layer beneath a policy engine.

## Lesson design philosophy

**Concept first, then practice, then self-grade.** The companion `LESSON.md` introduces the concept and mental model. The Killercoda `baseline/` scenario lets you see it working. The `breakfix-NN/` scenarios force you to debug it. The `ANSWER-KEY.md` shows the canonical diagnostic path so you can grade your own approach after — it's a learner-facing reference, not a hidden instructor key.

**One concept per break/fix scenario.** A scenario tests one diagnostic skill. Combining multiple bugs into one scenario teaches frustration, not Kubernetes.

**Depth scales with break/fix scenarios, not with LESSON.md length.** Each module identifies its load-bearing concepts — the ones an SRE needs cold at 3am — typically 2–3, occasionally 4 — and gives each of them full prose + an optional `<details>` deep dive + at least one break/fix scenario. Secondary concepts get covered in Vocabulary and the walkthrough but don't get dedicated depth treatment. The concept count is a default, not a cap: a module extends to a 4th scenario when it stays bite-sized and earns its place — most cleanly when the scenarios complete one coherent set (e.g. M02's four-branch pull-failure differential). Don't pad scenarios for symmetry; don't omit them to keep things short; prefer more small bites over one overstuffed scenario. Bite-sizedness is held by the per-scenario time budget and the LESSON length cap, not by a low scenario count.

**The platform is always the same.** Every lesson uses the same Polyphone fleet. Learners build familiarity with the same namespaces, the same workloads, the same vocabulary. By M10 they know the platform as well as they know their own production system.

**Earned vocabulary.** Each module assumes everything taught in earlier modules. `LESSON.md` cross-references back ("see M03 for Service basics"). The curriculum is cumulative, not encyclopedic.

**Production thinking.** Every `ANSWER-KEY.md` ends with a "what would you do in production" prompt. Diagnosis is necessary but not sufficient; reasoning about blast radius, runbooks, and post-incident action is what separates strong SREs.

**Authoritative references.** Every concept links out to k8s.io, kustomize.io, fluxcd.io, CNCF docs, or canonical IETF/3GPP terminology where appropriate. The curriculum is a curated path through the official docs, not a replacement for them.

## Voice and length

| Artifact          | Length target           | Voice                                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Sidebar `text.md` | ~300–600 words per step | Imperative, conversational, code-heavy           |
| `LESSON.md`       | ~1500–3000 words        | Explanatory, mental-model focused, well-linked   |
| `ANSWER-KEY.md`   | ~150–400 words per scenario | Terse, opinionated, what-to-watch-for          |

See `_internal/style-guide.md` for the full conventions.

Layers 3 batch workloads onto the fleet: `schema-migrate` (Job), `usage-export` (parallel Job), `cdr-rollup` (CronJob) |
| M02 Images & Registries| ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 4 shipped (`never-pull`, `registry-unreachable`, `imagepull-auth`, `digest-mismatch`) | Pull-failure differential (ErrImageNeverPull / no-such-host / 401 / manifest-unknown). Layers `media-recorder` + an in-cluster private `registry` (registry:2 + htpasswd) for baseline + the auth scenario; the other three mutate fleet workloads in place |
| M03 Configuration      | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 4 shipped (`configmap-key-missing`, `secret-volume-missing`, `stale-env-config`, `secret-double-base64`) | The four ways config breaks a workload (CreateContainerConfigError / FailedMount / stale env / runs-but-wrong). Wires `app-config` + `portal-secrets` into existing fleet workloads as env and as mounted files; no new workloads |
| M04 Networking I       | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`dns-cross-namespace`, `selector-mismatch`, `port-mismatch`) | Services & DNS. Request-path differential (NXDOMAIN / empty-endpoints / connection-refused). Exercises existing fleet Services; no new workloads (one cross-namespace DNS env carrier on `account-provisioner`) |
| M05 Storage            | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`pvc-storageclass-missing`, `pvc-claim-missing`, `rwo-multi-attach`) | PV/PVC, StorageClass, dynamic provisioning, RWO vs RWX. The storage `get pvc` differential (claim Pending / claim absent / claim Bound-but-unattachable). Exercises existing PVC-backed workloads (`cdr-writer`, `directory`); no new workloads |

The `Pending` differential (Insufficient memory / untolerated taint / pod anti-affinity) plus the runtime OOMKill counterpart. Layers 4 small workloads onto the fleet: `stream-analyzer` (oversized request), `pstn-probe` (missing toleration, worker tainted in `background.sh`), `sip-director` (3-replica required anti-affinity), `media-buffer` (busybox memory buffer, low limit) |
| M07 Workloads II       | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`headless-service-missing`, `ordered-rollout-stall`, `daemonset-node-coverage`) | StatefulSets & DaemonSets (batch → M01b). Identity/lifecycle/coverage differential (missing governing headless Service → NXDOMAIN per-Pod DNS / `OrderedReady` wedge behind ordinal-0 / DaemonSet drops an untolerated tainted node). Layers `session-store` (StatefulSet + headless, `app-services`) and `rtp-probe` (DaemonSet, `edge`) |
| M08 CRDs & Operators   | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`cr-schema-rejected`, `reconcile-stuck-rbac`, `orphaned-owner-reference`) | The controller pattern via a **real** operator — `tenant-operator`, a legible `bitnami/kubectl` reconcile loop (not a compiled controller) — plus a `MediaTenant` CRD. Operator-debugging differential (CRD enum rejects a bad CR at admission / operator ServiceAccount lacks RBAC → its `create` is 403-denied → stuck `.status`, no child, Running Pod / child born with no ownerReference → GC orphan). Layers CRD `MediaTenant`, `tenant-operator` (new `platform` ns), tenant CRs `orion`/`lyra` reconciled into child Deployments `orion-media`/`lyra-media` (`media`). ⚠ Not yet live-smoke-tested (bitnami/kubectl pull, reconcile timing). LLM judge 87/PASS |
| M09 Resilience & Autoscaling | ✅| ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`pdb-blocks-drain`, `hpa-no-requests`, `rollout-stuck`) | PDBs, HPA, rolling update/rollback, graceful shutdown. Resilience-control differential (PDB `minAvailable==replicas` blocks eviction / HPA `<unknown>/50%` with no CPU request / rollout wedged behind `ImagePullBackOff` → `rollout undo`). Layers `sip-registrar` (Deployment+PDB, `signaling`), `transcode-scaler` (Deployment+HPA, `media`), `portal-web` (Deployment, `admin-portal`); VPA/KEDA/Cluster-Autoscaler are concept-only (not installed on the cluster) |
| M10 Security I (RBAC)  | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 4 shipped (`rbac-missing-verb`, `serviceaccount-default`, `rbac-cluster-scope`, `podsecurity-restricted`) | RBAC + ServiceAccounts + SecurityContext + PodSecurity admission. Read the `Forbidden` as a four-field sentence (verb/resource/scope/identity); zero Pods = admission reject. Layers three `curlimages/curl` RBAC readers (`endpoint-watcher`/`media`, `route-watcher`/`call-routing`, `node-inspector`/`analytics`) + `payments-api` in a new PodSecurity-`restricted` `payments` namespace |
| M11 Security II (Secrets at Scale) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 3 shipped (`source-key-missing`, `store-access-denied`, `rotation-not-propagated`) | External-secrets sync via a **stand-in ESO**: a `SecretSync` CRD + `secret-operator` reconcile loop reading a `secret-operator-store` backing store (new `secrets-source` ns, standing in for Vault / a cloud secrets manager — disclosed). Sync-failure differential (missing source key / store RBAC denied / rotation not propagated to consumers). ⚠ Not yet live-smoke-tested. LLM judge 89/PASS |
| M12 PKI & TLS          | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`certificate-not-ready`, `san-mismatch`, `trust-mismatch`) | **Real cert-manager** (v1.16.2: CRDs + controller + webhook + cainjector) with a SelfSigned `selfsigned-bootstrap` ClusterIssuer → `polyphone-internal-ca` → leaf Certificates + an mTLS workload pair (`media`/`signaling`). Cert-lifecycle differential (Certificate stuck not-Ready / SAN ≠ requested host / peer doesn't trust the CA). ⚠ Not yet live-smoke-tested — **TOP ITEM: does the cert-manager install + webhook readiness finish within the background runtime cap** (the `no endpoints for cert-manager-webhook` race). LLM judge 86/PASS |
| M13 Observability      | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`logs-to-stdout`, `sidecar-crashloop`, `metrics-scrape-port`) | The built-in signals: events, container logs (+ the stdout contract), `kubectl top` metrics, and the application-metrics **scrape-annotation contract** (`prometheus.io/*` + a `/metrics` exposition endpoint) — taught WITHOUT installing a Prometheus stack (runtime-cap-safe). Dark-signal differential (app logs to a file not stdout → empty `kubectl logs` / metrics sidecar `metrics-agent` exit 127 → `1/2` CrashLoop / scrape-annotation port ≠ served port, observed by curling the annotated port). Layers `call-metrics` (Deployment + Service + exposition ConfigMap). ⚠ Not yet live-smoke-tested. LLM judge 88/PASS |
| M14 Networking II      | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`networkpolicy-default-deny`, `networkpolicy-cross-namespace`, `ingress-misrouting`) | Policy & Ingress. Extends M04's connectivity differential with two branches — the default-allow→default-deny + additive-allow model, cross-namespace `namespaceSelector` isolation, and Ingress host/path/backend routing. Installs the `ingress-nginx` controller (remote apply) + a healthy NetworkPolicy set; **no new fleet workloads** (policies/Ingress layered on the existing fleet, traffic from throwaway `busybox` clients). LESSON discloses the CNI-enforcement dependency thoroughly (a policy on a non-enforcing CNI is a stored no-op). ⚠ Not yet live-smoke-tested — **TOP ITEM: does the Killercoda cluster CNI enforce NetworkPolicy** (else bf-01/bf-02 are inert) + does the ingress-nginx install fit the background runtime cap. LLM judge 88/PASS |
| M15 Service Mesh       | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`sidecar-not-injected`, `virtualservice-subset`, `mtls-mode-mismatch`) | **Real Istio** (v1.24.2, `istioctl` minimal profile — istiod only, single-node-tuned) with sidecar injection on `media` (`istio-system` ns); mesh objects VirtualService / DestinationRule / PeerAuthentication. Mesh-failure differential (namespace not labelled → pod `1/1` sidecar-less / VirtualService routes to an undefined subset / mTLS `STRICT` vs a plaintext caller). ⚠ Not yet live-smoke-tested — **TOP ITEM: does the full Istio install + istiod-ready + injection webhook come up within the background runtime cap on one schedulable node**.

| M20 Kyverno/OPA        | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`require-limits-rejected`, `mutation-not-applied`, `image-tag-rejected`) | Policy track. **Real Kyverno** (v1.14.5, installed via `create`) with ClusterPolicies + validating/mutating admission webhooks (`require-resource-limits` validate, `add-owner-label` mutate, `disallow-latest-tag` validate). Policy-as-code differential (admission rejects a Pod missing limits / expected mutation absent / `:latest` image blocked). No new fleet workloads (policies on the existing fleet). ⚠ Not yet live-smoke-tested — Kyverno install + webhook enforcement within the runtime cap. LLM judge PASS |
| M21 Admission control  | ✅     | ✅         | ✅        | 3 shipped (`webhook-fail-closed`, `mutation-not-firing`, `webhook-scope-too-broad`) | Policy track. A **real minimal admission webhook** — `admission-guard` (python:3.12-alpine AdmissionReview server + self-hosted TLS, new `admission` ns) registered by a `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` + `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`. Webhook-mechanism differential (`failurePolicy: Fail` + webhook down → all admits blocked / mutation silently not firing / webhook scope/rules too broad). Complements M20 (Kyverno) by teaching the raw webhook layer beneath a policy engine. ⚠ Not yet live-smoke-tested — webhook + TLS/caBundle come up and enforce within the runtime cap. LLM judge PASS |

Identity/discovery/leadership differential (headless→ClusterIP kills per-Pod DNS → NXDOMAIN / `OrderedReady` wedge / leader-election Role missing `leases` verbs → no leader). Layers `session-cache` (StatefulSet + headless, `media`) and `call-coordinator` (active/standby singleton + staged `coordination.k8s.io` Lease, `call-routing`); assumes M07 for StatefulSet identity |

Update the `breakfix/` column with `N shipped (slug1, slug2, ...)` each time a scenario lands. Each module ships ≥1 break/fix scenario; additional scenarios get added as authoring proceeds and as failure modes worth teaching emerge.
